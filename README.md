# UDACTY-Analyze-AB-Test-Results
This Project is part of the Udacity  Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree Program, This is project two (Analyze A/B Test Results).
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
my goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
The project contains three parts:
1- Probability Test.
2- A/B Test.
3- A Regression Approach.
